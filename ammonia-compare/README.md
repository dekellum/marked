# ammonia-compare

This non-released sub-module includes compatible filtering with the default
settings of the *ammonia* crate (as of version 3.0.0) and comparative
benchmarks. Its split out into its own sub-module because we can't have an
optional ammonia dev-dependency, and *ammonia* is currently using an earlier
version of \*5ever.
